 Police in Port Elizabeth are warning pupils and their parents to conduct 'pens down' celebrations in a responsible manner. Motherwell SAPS Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie, added; "As SAPS we will not tolerate irresponsible street parties in our policing areas. "Parents should know that their children will celebrate the end of exams and possibly make all sorts of excuses of where they will be going in the next few days. We are urging parents to keep a close eye and not allow their children to attend unorganised and unruly street parties." In early July this year, a minibus taxi plowed through a crowd of children, killing three of them and seriously injuring three others, while they were consuming alcohol in the street in front of Eyethu Tavern in Njoli Street, Kwazakele. They were celebrating 'pens down'. "This horror incident sparked contoversy and widespread anguish for parents and community," said police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge. The SAPS wishes to invite people, who wish to convene such parties to get the neccessary permissions to conduct such open air celebrations from SAPS, and also to enable SAPS to plan and put measures in place to effectively police and ensure the safety of these gatherings.

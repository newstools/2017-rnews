 The attempt by Nelson Mandela Bay opposition parties to remove Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, and Council Speaker, Jonatha Lawack, in two motions of no confidence debates scheduled for Thursday's crucial Council Meeting, seem to be dead in the water. This is after the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), who hold the deciding vote, decided not to side with the parties that had joined with the African National Congress (ANC) in order to see the motions threw. After all the drama witnessed this year, the Democratic Alliance (DA)-led coalition has 59 seats in the 120 seat Council. The DA has 57 seats, while COPE and the African Christian Democratic Party have one seat each. On the one hand, the ANC has 50 seats while the minority parties, who intend to vote with them in the motions - the Patriotic Alliance, United Front, African Independent Congress, and United Democratic Movement, add a total of five seats. Thus, the deciding votes rest with the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), which has six seats. Until Thursday morning, it was anyone's guess as to whom the EFF would vote with. Early this year, EFF leader, Julius Malema, warned the DA and Trollip that they would withdraw support from coalitions in the Metro's if the DA continued with its "bullying" behavior. However, it was also unthinkable that the EFF would vote with ANC, given the history between the two parties. "The EFF will not support any of the opportunist motions of no confidence brought by the ANC in the Metros," said EFF Deputy President, Floyd Shivambu, in a Tweet. "Any rational and sensible South Africa will know that of all devils, the ANC in its present form is not an option &can’t be trusted with political power. They must go jump!" Ahead of the vote of no confidence, a confident Trollip addressed DA supporters, who gathered at the City Hall in Port Elizabeth to show their support for Trollip and Lawack.

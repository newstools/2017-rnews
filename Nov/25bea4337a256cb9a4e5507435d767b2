 Despite the local and global economic challenges and slower economic growth, such as the tax revenue shortfall estimated at R50.8 billion, a rising debt-to-GDP ratio and the revised growth for 2017 downwards from 1.3% to 0.7%, the Coega Development Corporation (CDC) has had a “significant and good year, contributing to the Eastern Cape Regional Economic Growth,” the CDC announced on Thursday. The CDC closes the 2017 calendar year with a record high in terms of operating investors, who on a monthly basis pay local workers’ salaries, provide ongoing training and development, and contribute towards the socio-economic development of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality and the Eastern Cape, at large.  To date, since inception, the CDC has recorded a staggering forty-one (41) operational investors in the Coega Special Economic Zone (SEZ). The latest investor to become operational in October 2017 includes Kenako Concrete, a R71 million state of the art concrete manufacturing facility located in Zone 5 of the Coega SEZ; this is the first black industrialist in Port Elizabeth to be funded by the Department of Trade and Industry (dti) together with the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC).

"We wish to thank all our 41 investors in the SEZ, the CDC Staff, Stakeholders, and the management of the CDC for a good performance year-to-date, despite going against a heavy economic tide locally and globally," the corporation said. "The CDC will officially be closed for business from 18 December 2017 and will re-open on 2 January 2018. We wish all of you a joyous and safe festive season."

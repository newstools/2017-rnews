 Over 250 delegates from industry, the government and academia will be meeting for two days to identify opportunities in the maritime sector and to plot a future growth path at the second South African Maritime Industry Conference. SAMIC 2017 will be hosted at the Sun Boardwalk Convention Centre in Port Elizabeth from Thursday, April 6 until Friday, April 7 2017. It follows on the first SAMIC, which was held in 2012. “When SAMSA (the South African Maritime Safety Authority) convened the inaugural SAMIC in 2012 as the first indaba of its kind to bring industry and government together to deliberate on a development agenda for the maritime sector, the landscape looked very different to what it is today. “Operation Phakisa was not yet on the horizon, SAIMI was still a pipe-dream, and the National Cadet Programme (NCP) was in its infancy,” says professor Malek Pourzanjani, chief executive officer of the South African International Maritime Institute (SAIMI). SAMIC 2017 is being organised by SAIMI. Speakers will be focusing on all aspects of the maritime economy. They represent industry, academia, government and financial institutions, according to Pourzanjani. The plenary session on the Thursday will look at the outlook for the maritime economy and identify trends, opportunities and challenges. This will be followed by breakaway sessions in the afternoon which will explore opportunities in a number of different sectors, including the South African offshore oil and gas exploration industry, ship-building and repairs, coastal and marine tourism and small harbours. “The definition of ‘maritime’ goes beyond shipping, into mineral and energy resources, sustainable fisheries, aquaculture, tourism opportunities and coastal infrastructure development,” says Pourzanjani. On day two the focus is on education and on creating a supporting regulatory framework for the maritime sector. To find out more about SAMIC 2017 visit the website www.samic2017.co.za.

 The Eastern Cape MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Fikile Xasa, is now compelled to conduct an investigation into Walter Sisulu Local Municipality, which includes the towns of Aliwal North, Jamestown, Venterstad, Steynsburg and Burgersdorp, after the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape wrote to him, highlighting instances of maladministration in the municipality. "The investigation into Walter Sisulu Local Municipality must be done in terms of section 106 of the Systems Act which states that if an MEC has any reason to believe that maladministration is occurring at a municipality, the MEC can, if necessary designate a person to investigate the matters," said Vicky Knoetze (MPL), the DA's Eastern CapeÂ Shadow MEC for Cooperative Governance. She said that this request by the DA comes as a result of numerous incidences that point to maladministration: "The financial situation in Walter Sisulu Municipality has reached crisis level and is no longer capable of acting autonomously especially in terms of its financial position," Knoetze added. "Provincial authorities must intervene as a matter of urgency in order to ensure that Walter Sisulu Municipality is able to meet its financial obligations and is in a position to deliver services to its people. "I will vigorously pursue this matter through the various legislature channels. The DA is committed to turning local government around in the Eastern Cape."

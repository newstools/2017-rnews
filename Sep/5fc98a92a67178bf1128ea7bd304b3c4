kulula.com and British Airways (operated by Comair) are proud to announce that they were successively named Best African Low-Cost Airline (kulula.com) and Best African Regional Short-Haul Airline (British Airways (Operated by Comair)) at the 6th annual Business Traveller Africa Awards, which was held in Sandton on Friday 1 September.Voting for the winners comprised of a number of sources within the South African business travel industry, including ASATA member travel agents, the African Business Travel Association s corporate travel buyers, the broader business travel industry and an astute panel of judges, led by SA Tourism Chief Marketing Officer, Margie Whitehouse. We re truly delighted to receive the award for Best African Low-Cost Airline for the third consecutive year and we are especially pleased to have won it in the same year that kulula.com celebrates its 16th year of existence within the South African airline industry. When we launched the kulula.com brand back in 2001 we wanted to make air travel more accessible to leisure travellers and it is a fantastic accomplishment to receive an award slanted more towards the business travel market, as it shows that kulula.com can play equally strong within both markets, says Shaun Pozyn, Head of Marketing, Customer Experience and Loyalty at kulula.com and British Airways (operated by Comair). On another note, we are equally proud to have received the award for Best African Regional Short-Haul Airline for British Airways (operated by Comair) as we continually strive to widen our African footprint by flying our customers to more destinations in Africa, whilst offering our signature British Airways hospitality onboard, he adds.Launched in 2012 in association with Business Traveller Africa magazine, the awards ceremony is an annual event on the South African tourism and travel calendar, which covers all aspects of business travel, including the four main areas, which consists of hotels, airlines, car rental and travel management, along with other categories related to the travel industry and its various service providers. Receiving these awards are very encouraging as they are proof that both our offerings to travellers and travel-buyers are on par when customers are looking for maximum value for their budget. In the spirit of tourism month in September this is a positive sign that we are successfully growing the domestic tourism industry by making travel easy, accessible, affordable and exciting. kulula.com and British Airways are incredibly proud of all the South African winners and nominees and we look forward to celebrate #WeDoTourism in the month to come, concludes Pozyn.

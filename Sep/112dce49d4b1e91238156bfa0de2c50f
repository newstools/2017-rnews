Police in Port Elizabeth have called on communities of the Northern Areas to join hands and assist them in exposing criminals, who are ruthless and place innocent lives at risk. This warning comes in the wake of the shooting of seven people on Saturday night in Bethelsdorp. According to police information, at about 20:45, the victims, aged between 9 and 26 years old, were standing in front of a supermarket in Lee Samuels Drive in Ext 35 when three unknown males approached on foot and starting shooting at the group."All the injured were taken to hospital," said police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu ."The Provincial Gang Investigation Unit is investigating cases of attempted murder."The Cluster Commander of Mount Road Cluster, Major General Funeka Siganga is appealing to the communities to report these criminals. If communities protect criminals, more victims will suffer and this motivates them to repeating their activities. Information may be supplied anonymously and will be followed up immediately. Let us work together in making sure that these callous criminals remain behind bars so that the communities are and feel safe, added Major General Siganga.

On Wednesday, official municipal valuers began collecting preparatory data in all the towns of the Kouga Local Municipality. The exercise is expected to conclude in mid-June.Kouga Local Municipality Executive Mayor Elza van Lingen said that the data collection would lay the groundwork for the compilation of the new General Valuation Roll for the period 2018 to 2023. There will be two data collectors taking photographs of properties. They might also have to enter some houses, she said."We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause, however, these preparations are important if we are to compile a credible valuation roll. The Mayor said that property valuation experts, DDP Valuers, had been awarded the tender to compile the new roll. The data collectors are Tjaart Venter and Bernardt de Klerk. They will be wearing identity tags in the interest of security, she said. However, if someone knocks on your door and you are not certain if it really is them, we ask that you call our Valuations Department at 042 200 8543 or 042 200 2157 so as to verify their identities before allowing them access to your premises. She said the draft valuation roll would be table to Council by the end of January 2018. Property owners will then be informed of the new valuation of their property and will have the opportunity to object should they believe the valuation is incorrect.The new valuations will determine how much property owners pay for rates from July 2018.

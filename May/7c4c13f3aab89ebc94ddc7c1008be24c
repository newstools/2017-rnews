An R11-million ground breaking budget for the 2017/18 financial year has been approved by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Friday night.The budget, along with the Integrated Development Plan (IDP), was approved with 66 votes at the full council meeting.Capital projects will project large quantities of the budget, namely: over R221-million towards housing delivery, R168-million for the Integrated Transport System and R300-million will go towards the re-surfacing of roads across Nelson Mandela Bay.The Assistance to the Poor (ATTP) programme allocated R580-million as the municipality s contribution to their support of the metro s households, while R40-million will go towards the Bucket Eradication Program.The opposition parties, however, deemed the budget not pro-poor, neither for it to create jobs. This, especially after 600 job losses were suffered when General Motors, one of the region s largest employers, announced last week that it was exiting South Africa.The ANC reportedly said that the budget was a Cape Town copy and paste and was an attack on the poor. Councillor Rory Riordan reportedly said that there was a complete abandonment of building new community facilities, particularly in the townships. Deputy Mayor, Mongameli Bobani, on behalf of the United Democratic Movement (UDM), announced his support for the budget. The UDM is independent of the DA and sometimes we disagree. The UDM is a part of this coalition whether someone likes it or not and as the UDM we support this budget, he said."The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality is for the first time tabling a draft budget that speaks to developing one city with one future, Mayor Athol Trollip said of the 2017/18 Budget and IDP presented draft in March."The draft 2017/18 budget sets a new benchmark for the delivery of better services, the eradication of corruption and the development of the economy to create jobs," the Executive Mayor said then."The Municipality is now moving towards expediting long-awaited projects that will unlock our City's potential."

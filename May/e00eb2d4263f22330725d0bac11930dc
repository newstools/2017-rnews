The African National Congress (ANC) Caucus in the Eastern Cape Legislature on Wednesday said that it is gravely concerned about the consistently high rate of violence towards women and children in the country.During the Legislature House sitting on Tuesday, ANC Whip Honourable, Vumile Lwana, remarked that the plenary sitting Gathers as the wave of male domination and the role played by some men in violence towards women and children is cresting in the wake of the murder of Karabo Mokoena, as well as the kidnapping and murder of numerous other women and children," he said."The incidence of rape, kidnapping and human trafficking is just too high. We wish to use this public platform to call for a cease fire on the war on women s bodies. Stop the war on our mothers, sisters, wives and daughters. This debate was preceded by two motions from ANC MPLs which were adopted by the House. Deputy Chief Whip of the ANC Caucus, Honourable Kholiswa Fihlani, moved a motion that condemned the merciless killing of a 4-year-old boy by his uncle, who proceeded to drink his blood and eat his heart in Port St Johns.She highlighted that at the time of committing this crime, the 30-year old uncle is reported to have been recently released from prison after having served a 7-year sentence for murder.She further noted the prevalence of crimes committed in the community of Mcobothini in Lusikisiki allegedly by an organised gang, which goes by the name Amavondo .Honourable Fihlani observed with deep concern that the alleged perpetrators in both instances are young men aged between 21 and 30 years, and stressed, in the gravest manner, concern over these acts which threaten the protection of the right to life as enshrined in the Bill of Rights.On Human Trafficking and sexual offences allegedly committed by a Durban-based pastor Timothy Omotoso, the ANC Caucus is committed to the fight against violence towards women and children, which has far-reaching ramifications beyond the actual abusive acts, and urges action also against the women who acted as recruits of young women and girls for such acts."The ANC Caucus highly condemns the use of religious convictions and people s reliance on faith as a tool to perpetuate ill-deeds, and rebukes the mushrooming of churches that take advantage of people s unemployment, poverty and inequality for selfish gains," said ANC Chief Whip in the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature: Honourable Mzoleli Mrara."Citizens are hereby cautioned against buying into organisations which could potentially harm their physical and emotional well-being."The ANC Caucus calls for a cease fire on the war on women and children s bodies, and pleads with communities to unite with law-enforcement agencies with the objective of uprooting these social ills in society."

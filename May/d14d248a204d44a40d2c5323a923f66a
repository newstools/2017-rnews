The African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) is expected to brief the media on Monday afternoon with speculation rife that President Jacob Zuma may have survived yet another vote of no confidence, which coincided with the leaking of damning emails that showed that the Guptas were indeed influencing decisions in government.The NEC met between Friday and Sunday outside Pretoria just as the emails were leaked.Despite the President's Nkandla homestead receiving security upgrades worth nearly R250 million, one of the emails shows the President asking that the Arab Emirates support his plan to set up a second family home in Dubai - perhaps an exit strategy?In another email, the directors of Oakbay Investments, who include the Gupta brothers - Atul, Ajay and Tony Gupta, were sent Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane's CV around two months before he was appointed to the post.The emails also show how the company paid for some ministers' overseas trips and how they would receive cabinet memo's.In one email, a PR Agency, looks like was going to be used to launch a smear campaign against former Deputy Minister of Finance and former Eastern Cape MEC for Economic Development, Mcebisi Jonas, after he revealed that he had refused a huge Gupta bribe and appointment to the position of Finance Minister.Zuma survived a similar vote of no confidencein December last year.The Presidency has since denied that President Zuma has plans to have a family home in Dubai.Oakbay has also labelled the leaked emails as fake news.On Friday night, Gupta-owned news channel, ANN7, revealed how National Treasury, under former Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan, allegedly turned a blind eye to unauthorised payments and double invoicing.DA calls for legal actionDemocratic Alliance (DA) leader, Mmusi Maimane, on Sunday said that the emails are "concrete proof confirming what South Africans have known for some time: the ANC has created, aided, and sponsored a shadow criminal state in South Africa, led by the Guptas and the Zumas".Maimane said that an array of cabinet ministers, state departments and entities, and public officials have systematically sold off South Africa to a small cabal of foreigners, "who are on our shores for one reason to loot our country of its resources in order to makes themselves rich"."This should anger anyone who hates injustice and cares about the future of our country."He said that the DA has consulted its lawyers with a view of taking legal action against Zuma, the Gupta family, implicated cabinet ministers, public officials, SOE executives and board members, and any other individuals who have acted to undermine the state."We believe there are a host of charges of the most serious order including grand corruption, undermining of state sovereignty, and various statutory offences including the leaking of classified information, and undue influence in the awarding of government contracts."The reports reveal written proof in the form of a string of emails which confirm that South Africa has been captured by the Guptas. From handpicking Cabinet Ministers, to appointing heads of SOE s, to winning multi-billion rand government contracts, the Guptas and the Zuma s have manipulated power in order to create a shadow criminal state which operates to enrich a few, and leave the majority of South Africans poor and jobless," Maimane said."Moreover, it was revealed that Jacob Zuma has been putting in place an exit strategy with the help of the Guptas to relocate to Dubai after he is finished raiding the country of its very last cent."It is clear that as the Gupta Capture scandals continue to grow, a Judicial Commission of Inquiry recommended by former Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela, must be established to swiftly investigate this matter and ensure that this corruption of an unprecedented scale is stopped once and for all. Today s revelations make it clear as to why Jacob Zuma is opposing the Public Protector s recommendations in court."He said that while 9 million South Africans have lost hope in ever finding work, and millions more are trapped in abject poverty, the ANC allows this Gupta-headed heist of our country to proceed unabated."In fact, today the ANC can remove Jacob Zuma at the sitting of its National Executive Committee (NEC). The NEC has the power to do so. Time will only tell if it has the will."If the ANC chooses to stand by Zuma and all his corruption again today, then no one within the ANC can claim innocence for this absolute pillaging of our country by a band of connected crooks. There must be collective blame on the whole ANC for partaking, benefiting, and allowing this to unfold," Maimane said."The ANC has past the point of no return. It cannot self-correct, and it cannot govern in the best interests of all South Africans."

The Kelston Motor Group, based in Port Elizabeth, continues to grow its success and have recently added their newest brand, BAIC, to the group. This is the first BAIC branch to open in the city and the Eastern Cape.The BAIC Automotive Group may not be that well known in South Africa but it has become one of the five largest automotive groups in China. With its headquarters located in Beijing and at the Turin Styling Centre in Italy and production bases all over China, BAIC Group is a Fortune 500 company.BAIC is currently building their multi-billion Rand factory at the Coega IDZ and so are very serious about doing business in South Africa. There is certainly no need to worry about spare parts for your BAIC.Like many successful Chinese cars, the D20 uses reliable and proven technology from other, more well-known, vehicle manufacturers from around the world. Thus the chassis is that of the Mercedes-Benz Smart Forfour and the steering comes from a SAAB patent.For a vehicle with a starting price of R149 995, it is packed with features including hi-fi sound, smart headlights and rear view mirror and airbags.Mahindra Genio LongMahindra has certainly grown in Port Elizabeth and with the launch of the new Mahindra Genio Long, this growth is expected to continue.Mahindra have a reputation for indestructability and are ideal for the country s farming community who frequent dirt roads and rough fields.The Genio departs from Mahindra s traditional box shaped vehicles and is combination of a typical bakkie and dropside mini-trucks such as the Hyundai H100 and Toyota Hino Dyna. With a carrying capacity of over 1000kgs and a large load carrying box, the Genio is very affordable with a starting price of R237 995.Peugeot 2008 SUVThe new Peugeot 2008 SUV was launched in South Africa in March of this year and consists of four models, spanning two engine choices, two transmission choices and three trim levels.The mid-life update for this SUV places a stronger emphasis on the 2008 s all-terrain DNA.The automaker says the interior has been upgraded to match the design and execution standards set by the award-winning 308 hatchback. The new i-Cockpit now includes a generous colour touch-screen display, with the latest-generation connectivity and ergonomics.The 2008 is perhaps the best value for money SUV on the market at the moment. The starting price of R274 900 is incredibly competitive and the features, interior and style are some of the best in the class.Karen MullerTest driveThe BAIC Mahindra Peugeot Port Elizabeth dealership is located at the Moffett Retail Park at 1 William Moffett Expressway.

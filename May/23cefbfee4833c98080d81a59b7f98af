PERFORMANCE OVERVIEWTurnover growth for TFG Africa (all operations on the African continent) was 8,0% for the financial year, with comparable sales growth of 2,8%.Cash turnover growth for the Group was slower in the second half at 9,5% (TFG Africa: 10,3%) resulting in full year growth of 18,5% (TFG Africa: 14,1%). Credit turnover grew by only 2,3%, impacted by fewer new account openings as a result of the Affordability Regulations.The Group achieved a gross margin of 49,7% (March 2016: 49,7%) for the year, while TFG Africa was 46,4% (March 2016: 46,9%), impacted by strong, lower margin, cellular sales (+ 15,3%).Total trading expenses increased by 12,8% (TFG Africa: 7,9%) over the previous year. The total expense growth is non-comp due to the inclusion of Whistles this year. BAD DEBT DECREASEThe retail debtors book of R7 billion grew by 4,6% compared to March 2016. The Affordability Regulations and the challenging economic environment have severely impacted the number of active accounts, which reduced by 5,4% compared to the previous year.Net bad debt decreased by 5,4% due to improved collection results and strong growth in recoveries. As a consequence of the modest growth of the debtors book and the lower credit turnover growth, net bad debt as a percentage of the closing debtors book was 11,3%, down from 12,3% at March 2016. The retail debtors book is conservatively provisioned at 11,8%, down from 13,2% at the previous year-end. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES REMAIN APPROPRIATEMr Murray says he remains confident about the future despite political and economic uncertainty, and the impact of the Affordability Regulations, Our continued commitment to our strategic objectives around customer, leadership, profit and growth will support our future success. Our investment in the UK and Australian markets strengthens our diversified portfolio of brands and provides a solid platform for further growth opportunities in these markets. The Group s turnover growth, in constant currency, for the first seven weeks of the 2018 financial year, is in line with management s expectations in the upper single digits across both TFG International and TFG Africa.

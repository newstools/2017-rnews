 Parents and children of all ages were enchanted and thoroughly entertained as Bayworld in Port Elizabeth hosted their annual Night @ the Museum treasure hunt event! Various museum exhibits at the facility came to life after dark - including dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus Rex; legends from history such as Marie Antoinette, Cleopatra and King Tutankhamen himself.  Volunteers from Cosplay PE were more than happy to help bring the show and the characters to life.  Families also participated in a treasure hunt that involved answering riddles for a chance to enter the lucky draw, which had awesome prizes.  And to add to the nights’ festivities, the Parkour Port Elizabeth group dressed up in their Assassins’ Creed gear and performed some amazing stunts for the guests. There was also a short skit where pirates fought over treasure in an action packed sword fight!  Despite the wind and rain, the turnout for the shows on Friday and Saturday were phenomenal as both nights shows were sold out completely.  It was rare to see the Bayworld museum so full and full of cheerful children, not only having fun solving clues for the treasure hunt, but also learning more about history in the process.

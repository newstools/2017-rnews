According to Stats SA, in quarter four of 2016, year-on-year employment gains were found in the transport, agriculture and finance industries which grew by 61 000, 59 000 and 56 000 jobs respectively.Through its work with transporters, the Recycling and Economic Development Initiative of South Africa (REDISA) is able to develop small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) while delivering on its objective of diverting waste tyres from landfills and cleaning the country of tyre waste.Tebogo Lenaine, owner of Motaba Projects in Rustenburg, is an example of a small business leader in the transport industry who is determined to create jobs and provide opportunities for his business.Tebogo is one of REDISA s registered transporters and he services dealers within the Rustenburg area. Tebogo is tasked with delivering waste tyres to the approved depots and processing plants. REDISA has made a huge impact in my life since I found out about the opportunity through a friend. In 2009, my wife passed away and I was not working."It was a very difficult time in my life, then I saw this opportunity and I went for it. I currently service my dealers on a daily basis, but on average each week I collect around 900 passenger tyres as well as almost 300 truck tyres, said Tebogo.The support provided by REDISA to registered transporters ranges from business plan development to assistance with tax clearance and registering the business.Training is also an essential part of uplifting SMMEs registered with REDISA and is something that will be continuously rolled out as part of REDISA s commitment to drive SMME and job opportunity targets. We want to ensure that the work we do has a lasting positive impact on the lives of many South Africans. It is our hope that through the SMME development support we provide, we equip entrepreneurial South Africans with invaluable skills that will not only make their lives better but also allow them to empower others and grow the logistics network, said REDISA Director, Stacey Davidson.

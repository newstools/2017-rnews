"For those travelling on the R67,there is lots of debris on the road that is not visible, we are trying to clean the road, but it won't be a successful story." "Please be aware, travel very slowly as you come toward the 43 Air School, as well as the Matu turn-off - lots of debris accross the road in that area," Cpt. Goveneder announced.

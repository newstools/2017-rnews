"According to GM, it is withdrawing because the South Africa can no longer 'provide GM with the expected returns of other global investment opportunities'," quoted Geordin Hill-Lewis MP - DA Shadow Minister of Trade and Industry."Following the President s reckless midnight cabinet reshuffle, and the subsequent ratings downgrade of our economy, GM s withdrawal is sadly just one of a growing list of foreign investors who are fast losing confidence in our struggling economy."GM currently employs 2 000 South Africans at its plant in Port Elizabeth, and their withdrawal will threaten the livelihoods of all of these workers."

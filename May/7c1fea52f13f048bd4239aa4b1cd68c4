The Legal Resources Cen tre, which is based in Grahamstown, on Tuesday said that on behalf of the Cen tre for Child Law and the School Gov ern ing Body of Phakamisa High School in the East ern Cape, it launched an appli ca tion in the Gra ham stown High Court on Friday to declare a deci sion made by the East ern Cape Depart ment of Edu ca tion (ECDOE) to stop fund ing learn ers with out iden tity, pass port or per mit num bers as uncon sti tu tional."This fol lows the announce ment made on 17 March 2016 that fund ing trans fers to schools for the Norms and Stan dards, post pro vi sion ing allo ca tion and National School Nutri tion Pro gramme (NSNP) for quin tiles 1 3 would be based on the learner num bers where valid South African iden tity, pass port and per mit num bers have been cap tured on the South African Schools Admin is tra tion&amp; Man age ment Sys tem," the centre said in a statement."The Norms and Stan dards trans fers include fund ing for learner-teacher sup port mate ri als (includ ing text books and sta tionery), munic i pal ser vices and school main te nance. The fund ing for NSNP is allo cated to each school in a sep a rate bud get. The post pro vi sion ing allo ca tion funds the salaries of teach ers and sup port staff."Many schools have already been affected by this announce ment and do not have suf fi cient teach ers or bud get for LTSM and theNSNP." In the appli ca tion, the LRC argues that, by with draw ing fund ing, the ECDOE is vio lat ing the learn ers con sti tu tional right to basic edu ca tion (sec tion 29), par tic u larly when it is read in con junc tion with the learn ers rights to dig nity (sec tion 10) and the right to equal ity and non-discrimination (sec tion 9)."The fund ing fail ure is also a gross vio la tion of the learn ers con sti tu tional rights to basic nutri tion (sec tion 28) and to have access to suf fi cient food (sec tion 27)."Fur ther more, the deci sion to exclude learn ers with out iden tity num ber, pass ports or per mits is not in the best inter est of the child and vio lates sec tion 28(2) of the Con sti tu tion," it said."In the past, schools were funded based on actual num bers of learn ers, regard less of whether they had valid iden tity, pass port and per mit num bers, not on those reg is tered in the sys tem."With out fund ing pro vided for learn ers with out iden tity, pass port and per mit num bers, schools will have less to spend on learn ers reg is tered in the sys tem, com pro mis ing their edu ca tion and nutri tion. To sup port those not reg is tered in the sys tem, schools will either have to fundraise for their short fall or will ask unreg is tered learn ers to leave." The centre further said that the appli ca tion argues that, any fail ure, whether inad ver tent or not, on the part of par ents to reg is ter their birth does not jus tify any action or deci sion adversely affect ing the rights of learn ers . "It notes that it is usu ally the poor est and most vul ner a ble learn ers that fail to obtain their iden tity doc u ments and that some bar ri ers to access ing these are insur mount able."Often par ents or guardians fail to take the nec es sary steps to reg is ter the birth of a child due to a lack of access to an office of the Depart ment of Home Affairs, the par ents not being in pos ses sion of the nec es sary doc u ments to have the birth reg is tered or as a direct result of migrant labour," the centre said."Fur ther more, the appli ca tion con tains infor ma tion regard ing the schools that are doing every thing in their power to assist learn ers obtain iden tity doc u ments and finalise pro vi sional learner enrol ment but are not able to do so."The appli ca tion seeks to have the deci sion by the ECDOE to be set aside and for the Depart ment to revise post estab lish ments and fund ing in line with actual num bers of learn ers in schools, regard less of their reg is tra tion sta tus."

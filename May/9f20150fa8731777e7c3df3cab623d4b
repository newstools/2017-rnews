The National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (NUMSA) will take General Motors South Africa to court if the company fails to fully disclose its deal with Isuzu, NUMSA General Secretary, Irvin Jim, said on Tuesday. Jim was addressing workers at a General Meeting for all workers, who were working at General Motors South Africa's Struandale plant, including those with pending cases against the GMSA.The meeting, which was at the Nangoza Jebe (Centenary Hall) in New Brighton, Port Elizabeth, comes after it emerged that nearly 600 workers will lose their jobs following General Motors South Africa's decision to sell light commercial vehicle manufacturing plant in Struandale to Japanese auto-maker, Isuzu.Around 2 000 workers were employed by GM at the plant - more were employed by companies servicing its value chain. Hence, job losses may go beyond the 600.Jim said that workers had done all they can to make sure the company is prosperous in South Africa, but as it turns out, "Capital knows nobody, knows no friend, it's all about greed and exploitation of workers." He said that NUMSA was there to defend the rights of the affceted workers and said the alternative option for affected workers must be somewhere where they can utilise their skills. Jim added; "But, before we can discuss alternatives, GMSA must disclose the nature of their deal with Isuzu... We will take GMSA to court if they cannot disclose all the information about their deal with Isuzu." He said that NUMSA has been engaging with GMSA on its decision to exit South Africa and how this will impact workers and small companies. Jim said that NUMSA might embark on a campaign for the boycott of GMSA products and cars. "If they are leaving, then they must leave with their products - we are saying if they want to sell products in South Africa, then they must make them here in South Africa," he explained.

The Minister has learnt of the announcement by General Motors South Africa (Pty) Ltd to cease some of their operations in South Africa with regret and concern for the numerous employees whose jobs and livelihood will be directly and indirectly affected as a result, said the Department of Trade and Industry.In addition, the Minister noted that the decision by General Motors as part of a broader, international strategic position by the company to exit certain markets and focus the organisation on target markets and products.This, said the Minister, is evidence through recent activities like pulling out of Europe in 2017 (Opel, Vauxhall brand sold to Peugeot SA) and the closure of a plant in Halol, India, in April 2017.Other activities include exiting Australia, in 2013, where there was a joint venture with Holden, the closure of a plant in Indonesia in 2015, as well as recent pronouncements by General Motors CEO Mary Barra that the focus of the organisation will in future be orientated towards the development and production of autonomous vehicles, electrification and connectivity. It should also be noted that the emerging global geo-political dynamics might have a bearing on some business decisions being made such as the recent confirmation of additional investment in the US coupled with further move of some parts production from Mexico. General Motors has had a presence in South Africa since 1926, under various brands such as Buick, Chevrolet, GMC, ISUZU, Oakland, Oldsmobile and Vauxhall....

"According to GM, it is withdrawing because the South Africa can no longer 'provide GM with the expected returns of other global investment opportunities'," quoted Geordin Hill-Lewis MP - DA Shadow Minister of Trade and Industry."Following the President s reckless midnight cabinet reshuffle, and the subsequent ratings downgrade of our economy, GM s withdrawal is sadly just one of a growing list of foreign investors who are fast losing confidence in our struggling economy."GM currently employs 2 000 South Africans at its plant in Port Elizabeth, and their withdrawal will threaten the livelihoods of all of these workers."

The Eastern Cape Chamber of Business (ECCOB), in partnership with the chamber's biggest contributor, Vodacom, hosted a breakfast session on Tuesday at the East London Golf Course.The session was also attended by Eastern Cape Premier, Phumulo Masualle.The purpose of the breakfast session was to launch the ECCOB's Metros Chapters and Regions, as well as to take stock on developments made thus far in ensuring that the Eastern Cape business sector is sustainable.At the same event, Vodacom and the ECCOB announced a new partnership to assist with the digitalisation of SMEs in the province.Speaking at the Vodacom s breakfast session, the Premier said, "The world has entered the fourth industrial revolution - in the sense of new ways of producing things and relating to one another in reference to the economy. While it might look elementary, I think it is a giant step enabling us to be able to relate and compete in what is becoming a world standard - the use of technology in how we transect as businesses."So this is truly a momentous development and it should be that the business corporates, perhaps in the space a business can take leaf from what Vodacom has done. He also applauded stakeholders for adapting to changing times. The traditional way of thinking in which you will think that we will have many people employed by government doesn t work any more because we cannot succeed if government works alone, we need to work together with the private sector," Premier Masualle described.He added that government must look to assisting small and medium black enterprises to be able to meet the challenges of today.Also speaking at the Vodacom breakfast session, President of ECCOB, Mr Ntabati, appealed to government to protect local businesses from foreign competitors. We need to have our own in this area, in this province an in our regions - we don t need people coming from everywhere, which is currently happening. You see what is happening in infrastructure [development], you see foreign registered trucks and equipment - it means that we are creating foreign black industries, and we are not empowering our own which is not right, we like development but our people must taste it first, Ntabati said.

Eastern Cape police on Tuesday said that efforts to rid the province of criminal activities in line with the SAPS' Back to Basics policing approach is bearing fruits."During the past week, police arrested 2 144 suspects for various crimes ranging from murder, attempted murder, robberies, assault with intent to cause grevious bodily harm, to name but a few, across the province," police said. "248 various types of dangerous weapons, 38 firearms and 348 rounds of ammunition were also seized. "The suspects have appeared before different magistrates courts." All the seized firearms will be sent for ballistic testing to ascertain if they have not been used in any commissioning of crime. According to Eastern Cape Provincial Commissioner, Lt Gen Liziwe Ntshinga; The roll-out of the Cluster Operational Command Centres in all clusters is yielding results."The purpose of the cluster operational command centre is to ensure that operational policing services are directed and coordinated with the aim to prevent and combat crime in areas that are crime infested. Part of this proactive approach is to continue highly visible patrols by uniformed police officers, in line with our Back to Basics policing approach."Unrelenting efforts by SAPS in combatting the theft of motor vehicles is also paying dividends, with the recovery of 18 suspected stolen vehicles, which were also recovered in the past week.

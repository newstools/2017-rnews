Intercement South Africa (also known as NPC) has entered into an agreement with Oricol Environmental Services to co-process liquid and sludge waste in its cement kilns near Port Shepstone in KwaZulu-Natal.This involves the recovery of energy and minerals from the waste whilst reducing greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel consumption, raw material consumption and diverting waste from landfill. Oricol Environmental Services sees this as an important step in diverting high calorific and liquid sludge wastes from landfill or incineration which can be used as alternative energy source while protecting the environment, said Richard Sanders, founder and chief executive, Oricol Environmental Services. The net result will be a reduction in carbon emissions as waste previously destined for landfill will now be used as a cleaner burning coal replacement. In terms of the agreement, Oricol will source high calorific wastes, blend these at a purpose built facility and deliver them to Intercement s kiln near Port Shepstone.InterCement will manage the waste in an environmentally responsible manner and in accordance with the Waste Management License already granted by the Department of Environmental Affairs.The liquid wastes that will be selected include hydrocarbons, oils, solvents and other materials that meet strict acceptance criteria and authorised air emission limits of the cement kilns.Many waste streams are currently being disposed on landfills or incinerated. The use of these wastes as an alternate fuel is a preferred, proven technology and considered to have an important role in solving the many challenges posed to society by waste.The need to move towards a circular economy has pushed both waste generators and the cement industry to optimise the entire value chain by using waste as a resource.Not only will the process reduce the environmental footprint of cement kilns, it will also help ensure a sustainable future for the cement industry as a whole and society at large.The capture area for these liquid wastes include KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Gauteng.

 It was a superb weekend for Graeme sport, with undoubtedly the u15A rugby team being the outstanding performers. The 1st XI hockey has also improved dramatically this year, and enjoyed two wins on the first day of the KC Fest which would be seen as significant upset wins. They proved to be competitive in all their games, and are quickly becoming a team that is hard to beat. The 1st XV rugby side also displayed more good running rugby as they did well to ease past IthembelihleÂ at the Grey Festival. 1st XI Hockey at Kingswood Fest: Won 1-0 vs Merryfield Won 2-0 vs Stirling Lost 2-0 vs Hudson Lost 6-0 vs Woodridge Lost 2-0 vs Glenwood House U15A Rugby at SAC Festival: Won 7-5 vs Clifton Won 19-0 vs St Andrews School Won 15-5 vs Uplands Won 17-10 vs St Benedicts Won 26-24 vs St Albans Grey Rugby Festival: U14A won 20-12 vs St Davids U16A lost 52-5 vs St Johns 1st XV won 46-0 vs Ithembelihle

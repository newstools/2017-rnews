A sectional title complex may be attractive to potential investors or buyers due to the fact that there are open spaces and common garden areas.These open spaces and areas may however be subject to the right of the developer of the scheme to build further units or facilities thereon.Section 25 of the Sectional Titles Act makes provision for a developer of a scheme to apply to the Registrar of Deeds for the right to develop the scheme further within a specified time period.It is therefore important for purchasers to ascertain whether the developer of the scheme has reserved such a right to develop the scheme further and if such a right exists which areas may be further developed and to what extent.A Conveyancer will be able to assist you to establish whether such a right exists and the nature thereof.For more information on the implications of such rights in a sectional title scheme, contact Goldberg &amp; de Villiers Inc, the Directors in our Property Law Department, namely Adri Ludorf, Tracey Watson-Gill and Nicolas Mitchell, assisted by Bardine Hall will gladly assist you with any of your Property Law-related needs

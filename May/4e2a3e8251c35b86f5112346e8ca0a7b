Police in the Eastern Cape say that efforts towards creating safer communities are yielding results with the recovery of 13 illegal firearms, seven magazines and 40 rounds of ammunition from criminals in the past week alone. "A total of 16 suspects, aged between 25 and 43, were arrested and charged for illegal possession of firearm and ammunition," said police spokesperson, Capt Khaya Tonjeni."The suspects are expected to appear in the various courts this week facing these charges. All the firearms will be sent for ballistic tests to ascertain if they have been used in any commissioning of crime."Eastern Cape Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga, congratulated the members for the recoveries and assured the members of the community that SAPS in the province will ensure that we recover and confiscate all types of dangerous weapons including illegal firearms and ammunition. The recovery of firearm and ammunition is a step towards achievement of a safer Eastern Cape as these firearms are utilized in violent crimes like robberies, hijacking and murder. I encourage our members to ensure their own safety first when dealing with armed and violent criminal elements of the community."I would also like to thank community members who continue to share valuable information with us as some of these firearms are recovered through valuable information shared by the community members, said Lieutenant General Ntshinga.Capt Tonjeni said that inroads were also made in combating the theft of motor vehicles, when seven suspected stolen vehicles were recovered and five suspects were subsequently arrested."Strategic deployment of members at various key locations paid dividends in curbing crime and ensuring the recovery of the stolen vehicles. Utilization of modern technology also plays a huge role in the recovery of some of the suspected stolen vehicles," he said."These suspects are expected to appear in the various courts this week facing charges ranging from theft of motor vehicle, hijacking to name but a few . All the vehicles have been returned to the elated rightful owners after all the necessary processing have been finalized."

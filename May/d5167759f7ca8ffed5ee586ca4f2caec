In recent years, over six students have been killed, mostly by being stabbed by fellow students at Walter Sisulu University (WSU) campuses with alcohol reported as a major factor in the violence, Hlomela Bucwa, Democratic Alliance Student Organisation (DASO) Eastern Cape Constituency Leader."The latest victim is Lwando Mantshontsho from Mthatha Campus, a final year Medical student, who was assaulted and killed," she said."DASO condemns these criminal acts and calls on the University and law enforcement agencies to prosecute those responsible for the killing of Lwando. We believe that our campuses should remain safe spaces of living and learning with all students feeling secured."Lwando, from Cofimvaba, is believed to have died after students turned on each other after a night of heavy partying and drinking. Bucwa said that this is not only an issue at WSU, but across institutions and continues to expose the threat to safety of students, whose primary mandate are to study, pass and go back to their communities and address the socio-economic issues and imbalances we face as a society. "We call on management from all institutions together with the Department of Higher Education to prioritise and address safety issues on our campuses by deploying well trained and qualified security personnel, the installation of monitored CCTV camera's, and most importantly, strictly regulating the use of alcohol on our campuses and promoting responsible use," she added."We would also like to send our deepest condolences to the Mantshontsho family whose dream was to see their son becoming a medical doctor by the year 2018."We further call for calm and peace amongst students on campus in this difficult time."

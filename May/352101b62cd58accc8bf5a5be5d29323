The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Wednesday said that it has it on good authority that Eskom is currently in the process of destroying key documents and correspondence relating to the re-appointment of its former CEO, Brian Molefe."Does Eskom, and possibly the Board, have something to hide?" asked Natasha Mazzone MP, the DA's Shadow Minister of Public Enterprises."Lynne Brown, as the Minister of Public Enterprises, must investigate and confirm if this is the case, and if it is, must ensure that no further documents are destroyed."This information combined with the series of revelations over the last week only strengthen the DA s call for an urgent and full-scale Parliamentary inquiry into what is actually going on at Eskom."The sooner this inquiry begins, the better. Not only for restoring Eskom but in the greater public interest."There has been a public outcry from all political parties over the Eskom Board's recent decision to re-hire Molefe after he left the power utility last year under a cloud after being fingered for corruption in the Public Protector's State Capture Report.

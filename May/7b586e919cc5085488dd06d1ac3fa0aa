The Rental Housing Tribunal was established in 2001 to help resolve disputes between tenants and landlords. The members are appointed by the provincial Minister of housing and charged with the important task of implementing the Rental Housing Act.The Tribunal informs both landlords and tenants of their rights and obligations, investigates and mediates relevant matters and aims to get the parties to reach a resolution. The landlord and tenant are the parties to make a final decision about the mediation; if they are in agreement it can be made an order of court.It is also important to note that the services of the Tribunal are free to both tenants and landlords, and parties can choose to represent themselves, making the Tribunal a cost effective means for parties to resolve disputes.In addition the Tribunal can mediate on both written and verbal lease agreements, deposit refunds etc. Although the lease may be verbal, it is important to note the complaints to the Tribunal must be in writing.For more information on the process of lodging a complaint with the Tribunal, please read: www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/569/162161.

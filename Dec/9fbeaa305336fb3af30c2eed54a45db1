 A total of 14 traffic fines with an estimated value of R21 000 were issued to motorists as Mdantsane police on Tuesday cracked down on unlicensed drivers as well as those driving unlicensed motor vehicles and unroadworthy vehicles. According to police spokesperson, police held a roadblock in the entrance of Mdantsane dubbed 'Operation Fiela', which formed part of safer festive season operations. "This official roadblock was aimed amongst other things at intercepting criminals from inter-transporting stolen goods and drugs in and out of Mdantsane, tracing for wanted suspects to mention but a few," he added. "Pamphlets with messages of 16 Days of Activism against abuse of woman and children were distributed at the roadblock. These pamphlets were encouraging community members to act against abuse of woman and children instead of looking away. "Breaking the silence on domestic violence, reject stolen goods. Stop abuse of drugs and liquor." Captain Mzuku said that Major General Henry Vos was the commander of the operation. He was leading by example during the legal searching of vehicles and full body search. "These roadblocks will be held around the cluster in different policing precincts during the festive season to ensure the safety of our people."

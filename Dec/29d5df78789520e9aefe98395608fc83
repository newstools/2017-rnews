 The Commander for the Mount Road SAPS Cluster, Maj Gen Funeka Siganga, has warned officials, who choose to involve themselves in criminal behaviour. This comes after the arrest on Thursday last week of a 31-year-old police Constable on a charge of murder. He was arrested by the Provincial Gang Investigation Unit, which is working to address gang violence in Port Elizabeth's Northern Areas. "It is alleged that in February 2017, the member was involved with well-known gang members in executing a murder on a state witness," said police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "Months of intensive investigation resulted in the Constableâ€™s arrest." He will appear in court on Monday. "Police officials associating with criminal elements will be harshly dealt with. Members must work with integrity and refrain from any form of corrupt and criminal activities," added Maj Gen Siganga.

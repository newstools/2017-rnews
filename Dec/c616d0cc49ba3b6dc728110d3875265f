 A team of investigators has over the last few months discovered more than 2 100 hidden municipal leases in the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, revealed Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip. "A forensic audit of a small sample of these leases has revealed eleven cases of outright corruption and theft. These alone have lost the Municipality over R4 million - a figure that rises every month," he added. "The 2 100 recently uncovered leases could be losing the Metro hundreds of millions of rand every year. "The major findings relate to illegal subletting, irregular leasing, illegal occupation and irregular application of council resolutions." Trollip said that certain individuals are involved in many of the cases, which speaks to this possibly being an organised syndicate-like operation. "With an updated lease register of 2 600, the investigators will now begin an audit of all leases. "This coalition government will not be lenient with those implicated in irregularities," the Mayor added. "Public money will be recovered. Those responsible will be dismissed. Suspects will be handed over to the Police for criminal proceedings. "Corruption is no longer tolerated in Nelson Mandela Bay. Change is here!" Â

 At a press conference held at Nasrec, Johannesburg, where the African National Congress (ANC) is holding its 54th National Elective Conference, outgoing Secretary General, Gwede Mantashe, told journalists that the ANC is aiming to regain all the Metros that it lost in the 2016 Municipal Elections. Through various coalitions, the Democratic Alliance (DA) beat the ANC in Nelson Mandela Bay, Tshwane and Johannesburg, which had been in ANC hands since the dawn of democracy in 1994. “We want to regain all the metros and we want to be a strong ANC. We can’t have doubts about 2019, we must work hard to win them and win them well,” Mantashe told the press. “Where we have lost ground, we want to regain the lost ground, by that we mean that we want to regain the Metros.” He added that party’s solution is to work hard to win the hearts of voters. “We want to be a strong ANC, so anybody that wants to question if we have doubts about 2019, we can’t have doubts in 2019. We must work hard to win them and win them well. We must improve to where we were in 2016 elections.” He acknowledged the weaknesses of the ANC and added that all parties face challenges. “There will be problems like any other organisation grows, peaks, matures, stagnates and then declines,” Mantashe said. “We want a better ANC because a better ANC is good for the country. Leading is exciting, but sometimes it’s not all about leading, it is about the personality of the individual and you cannot school anybody about that one because it is in the person.”

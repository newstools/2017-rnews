 The Mthatha High Court on Monday sentenced a 50-year-old woman, Nomnandi Mabhude, and a 25-year-old man, Thabo Tshezi, to undergo life imprisonment plus three years after convicting the duo on murder and kidnapping charges. "Conviction comes after the accused were charged for kidnapping and murder of a 14-year-old boy, who was later dumped in the school toilets," said police spokesperson, Capt Edith Mjoko. Nomnandi was the boy's aunt. His body was found following a week-long search after the boy disappeared from his home in Nkantolo village, outside of Bizana, in February this year. It emerged that Vuso Mabhude had been kidnapped when his family was contacted by people, who demanded a R6 000 ransom. He was apprently killed that same day. The kidnapping and murder is suspected to have been part a family feud. "Swift investigation by Captain Freemantle and his team led to the arrest and conviction of the suspects," said Capt Mjoko. Cluster Commander, Brigadier Mtutuzeli Mtukushe, welcomed the sentences.

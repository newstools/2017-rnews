 A 27-year-old male suspect from Port Elizabeth was arrested on Sunday, just after 13:00, for attempted murder. "This follows after a 32-year-old female was shot in both legs and hip on Saturday night, just before 22:00, at a home in Mshakaza Street, Kwazakele," described police spokesperson, Capt Andre Beetge. "The victim is believed to be his girlfriend and is suspected to be a domestic violence related incident." He said that although the suspect's motive for the attack is still being investigated, the suspect is believed to been released from St Albans Prison recently after been suspected of numerous violent crimes of robberies and car hijackings since as early as 2009. "Most cases have been withdrawn and some cases are still before court. "The suspect will be appearing before the New Brighton Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday on a charge of attempted murder," said Capt Beetge. "Further investigation in this case will continue."

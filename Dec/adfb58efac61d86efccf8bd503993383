 The National Individual Tracker winner, Sgt Shaun Dicks, from Port Elizabeth K9 Unit on Wednesday donated his cheque of R10 000 to his local Animal Anti-Cruelty League in Port Elizabeth. Sgt Dicks first won the Provincial Individual Tracker Award and then went on to scoop the National Individual Tracker Award for 2017. The PE K9 unit also won the Provincial Unit Award. Ms Beverley Rademeyer from Animal Anti-Cruelty expressed her gratitude and appreciation to Sgt Dicks for thinking of the animals who so much need care and treatment. "The money will be utilised in January 2018 when we go on a spay and dip-athon exercise which will help about 300 dogs and cats. The money will assist for general examination and medicines," she added. Meanwhile, the Deputy Provincial Commissioner: Policing, Maj Gen Andre Swart, also expressed his congratulations to Sgt Dicks and added that "this achievement must also serve as an inspiration to other members to continue serving their communities with the skills you have been equipped with". "The Eastern Cape and Port Elizabeth in particular is proud to win the National Individual Awards for the past two years. This just shows that amid challenging circumstances at times, our members still excel in their vocations," added Maj Gen Swart. The Executive for Operational Services from Tracker, Mr Ron Knott-Craig stated that "today is about recognition and celebrating the culmination of hard work, consistent effort, commitment to doing things right and passion for achieving results. I would also like to compliment Sgt Dicks on his choice of beneficiary".

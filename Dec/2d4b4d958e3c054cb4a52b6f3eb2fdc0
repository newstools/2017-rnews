 The published list of new African National Congress (ANC) members elected to the party’s highest decision-making body, the National Executive Committee (NEC), shows that they are far from ridding themselves of President Jacob Zuma’s legacy of cronyism, corruption and state capture, the Democratic Alliance (DA) said on Thursday. Accoridng Refiloe Nt'sekhe - DA National Spokesperson and Deputy Chairperson, the listincludes the following high profile individuals with less than savoury track records: "The unashamed inclusion of these names in the new National Executive Committee shows that the ANC’s promises of self-correction were a myth. Newly elected President of the party, Cyril Ramaphosa, built his campaign on the idea that cutting the head off the snake will kill it, but instead the snake has simply shed its skin," Nt'sekhe added. "That the above listed individuals, and others on the list, can not only avoid accountability for their actions, but can be rewarded with decision making power within the ruling party, shows that the ANC cannot, or will not self-correct. "South Africans must take matters into their own hands in 2019 and shed themselves of the ANC in favour of a multi-party coalition government with democratic principles as their foundation."

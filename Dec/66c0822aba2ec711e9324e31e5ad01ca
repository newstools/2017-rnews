 The Democratic Alliance (DA) has retained Ward 5 in Humansdorp in a by-election held in the Kouga Local Municipality on Wednesday.  A vacancy occurred in Ward 5 when former DA councillor, Desmond Peterson, was expelled from the Party following a disciplinary process. "In a tightly contested by election 1921 out of the 3622 registered voters braved the windy and rainy weather conditions in Humansdorp to cast their votes. Translating to 53% voter turn out, DA received 763 votes, ANC 612, Independent candidate 517 and EFF 8," described Nqaba Bhanga - DA Eastern Cape Provincial Leader. He said DA-governed Kouga Municipality has made huge strides in improving service delivery, stopping corruption and creating jobs. "Since we were elected in August 2016, we have undertaken massive upgrade of bulk services and that made possible the construction of 391 houses. The first new houses build in 11 years. "The corrupt sale of 183 hectare piece of prime land for a far below market related amount of R1,2 million was overturned by the high court following the DA led Municipality requesting a review of a Council decision to sell the land. An independent valuation later revealed that the land is worth R 50 million," Bhanga added. "A call centre established in October has logged 2 300 service delivery complaints so far, with the Kouga Municipality resolving 2 000 of these complaints. The Link App allows residents to report issues via their phones and they are able to monitor progress regarding their complaints." The DA candidate, Wilma Coenraad, represents a new beginning for the people of Ward 5. "I’d like to congratulate Wilma and wish her the best as she serves the people of her ward. She is a true servant of the people," Bhanga said.

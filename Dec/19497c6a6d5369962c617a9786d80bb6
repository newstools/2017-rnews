 The African National Congress (ANC) has a new National Executive Committee (NEC), which was elected on Wednesday at the party's 54th National Elective Conference, which was held at the NASREC Expo Centre in Johannesburg. The new NEC was only announced early on Thursday morning after vote counting was delayed. With the highest number of votes is former ANC treasuer-general, Zweli Mkhize, who dropped out of the party Presidency race at the last minute citing a wish to maintain unity in the party. The top ten include Lindiwe Zulu, David Masondo, Ronald Lamola, Malusi Gigaba, Zizi Kodwa and Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, who was defeated by Cyril Ramaphosa in the race to succeed her ex-husband, President Jacob Zuma. On the list are Ramaphosa backers, who include Derek Hanekom (an ex-Minister), Minister Angie Motshekga, Pravin Gordhan (an ex-Minister) and Jackson Mthembu. ANC Women's League President, Minister Bathabile Dlamini, who backed Dlamini-Zuma, together with Minister Nomvula Mokonyane, both did not make it back on to the NEC. South African Communist Party (SACP) leader, Blade Nzimande, and former deputy Finance Minister, Mcebisi Jonas, as well as Minister Thulas Nxesi also did not make it.  Some of the more controversial NEC members include former Deputy Minister, Mduduzi Manana, who resigned from government after assaulting two women at a club - he was later convicted of the crime, as well as former Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson.

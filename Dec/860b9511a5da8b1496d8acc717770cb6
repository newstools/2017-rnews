 The Democratic Alliance Students' Organisation (DASO) in the Eastern Cape on Friday said that it is ready to welcome all prospective and returning students for the 2018 academic year. "Thousands of students travel and arrive in institutions of higher learning to sleep in labs and on the streets with no one to welcome them," the DASO Eastern Cape Constituency Executive said in a statement. "Ours is to ensure that we assist students with any issues they face to the best of our abilities to ensure that no student is left behind as we usher in a new beginning for South Africa. These may include admissions, readmissions, financial aid, student accommodation and special needs. "This we will do through our annual Sakh'ingomso campaign which we will roll out from the 4th of January in all campuses with help desks set up to assist all students." DASO Eastern Cape said that all students and parents are welcome to inbox their social media pages for assistance or advice on any issues. "We believe that education is the cornerstone of the liberation of all young South Africans and that a government that does not invest in the education of its youth, is a government that does not care about the future," it added. "We will work hard to ensure that all students access institutions of higher learning and that no student is left behind."

 The Democratic Alliance National Leader Musi Maimane says that the newly elected African National Congress (ANC) President, Cyril Ramaphosa must prove his loyalty to the rest of South Africa by recalling and jailing his predecessor, Jacob Zuma. Maimane said that Ramaphosa has been silent for years while standing in the shadow of Jacob Zuma, with that said corruption and oppression of South Africans will continue. “Ramaphosa has relied on David Mabuza to secure a marginal victory, in turn electing him as Deputy President. As Premier of Mpumalanga, Mabuza has presided over a collapsing province, characterised by maladministration and corruption, while keeping people in poverty,” he added. Maimane advised Ramaphosa to recall Zuma as President of the South Africa to prove a non-tolerance to any kind of corruption. “Ramaphosa's first act as ANC President must be to recall Jacob Zuma as President of the South Africa, prosecuting him for his corruption charges, and jailing him if he is found guilty,” he described. He added that failing to do so, would demonstrate to South Africans that ANC leaders are friends of corruption. “In addition to this, Ramaphosa must ensure an immediate plan of action is adopted, which seeks to do the following: “These are the short term interventions that Ramaphosa must urgently action,” he advised. According to Maimane the DA is prepared to work with any political party, as they continue to prepare for the 2019 national elections. “We are committed to working with any political party committed to constitutionalism; stamping out corruption; building a non-racial South Africa; educational and work opportunities for the youth; and a policy suite focused on creating prosperity for all South Africans – especially those left behind.” “This is the South Africa we seek to build, and our project continues regardless of who leads the ANC, Maimane concluded.

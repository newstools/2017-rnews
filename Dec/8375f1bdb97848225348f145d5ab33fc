 Four convicted robbers were re-arrested by Port Elizabeth police less than 24 hours after they made a daring escape from custody on Wednesday afternoon. According to police information, two members of the court were transporting sentenced prisoners to St Albans Correctional Services after court proceedings. "They were travelling in Gail Road, between Ext 5 and 6 Malabar, when the driver heard noises at the back of the truck," described police spokesperson, WO Alwin Labans. "He noticed prisoners jumping from the top of the truck. Escapees fled into the nearby bushes. "They were sentenced for robbery, which occurred in the Mount Road and Bethelsdorp areas." WO Labans said that an immediate search operation was conducted by members and the assistance of the Airwing was brought in. "The escapees are still at large. They are known and will be arrested soon." On Thursday morning, police confirmed that Justin Bramwell, Ettienne Andrews, Marco Tiervlei and William Kleinbooi, were re-arrested overnight. They are now likely to face an additional charge of escaping lawful custody.

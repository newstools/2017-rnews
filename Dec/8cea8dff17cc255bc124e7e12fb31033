 Just days before the African National Congress' (ANC) National Elective Conference, the Grahamstown High Court is expected on Tuesday to rule on the legitimacy of the party's 8th Eastern Cape Provincial Elective Conference that took place at the end of September. ANC delegates at that conference, believed to be supporters of former ANC Eastern Cape Chairperson and current Eastern Cape Premier, Phumulo Masualle, launched an urgent bid to have the conference be declared null and void after apparently being prevented from participating in the voting. In the end, former ANC Eastern Cape Provincial Secretary, Oscar Mabuyane was elected the new ANC Eastern Cape Chairperson, by a massive 935 votes - beating Masualle, who got only seven votes. The conference itself saw delays as delegates caused interruptions leading to violence that saw around eight delegates taken to hospital.  But before Mabuyane could celebrate his elections, he was told of another urgent court interdict, which was heard in the East London High Court in October. While Judge Belinda Hartley ruled that the papers filed for that interdict could be used for a possible review of the conference, she struck the application off the rolland ruled that the applicants had to pay the costs of the application. The ANC in the Eastern Cape at the beginning of December overwhelmingly endorsed Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed President Jacob Zuma at this weekend's National Elective Conference, following its Special Provincial General Council (PGC) in preparation for the upcoming conference. In October, the newly-elected ANC Eastern Cape had also endorsed Ramaphosa.

 Newly-elected African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, remains in his position following a recount of the votes called on by supporters of his rival, Senzo Mchunu. However, this time he only leads Mchunu by a marginal nine votes after the agency monitoring voting at the ANC's 54th National Elective Conference, Elexion, allocated Mchunu a further 15 votes. This follows reports of 68 votes that apparently went missing in vote for the Secretary-General position. A legal team, led by Advocate Dali Mpofu, is understood to be awaiting instructions to go to court over the missing ballot and the Secretary General position. Ace Magashule is the current Premier of the Free State and a known Jacob Zuma supporter. He has also been accused of corruption while leading the Free State. On the other hand, Senzo Mchunu is a former Premier of the KwaZulu-Natal and was known to be a Cyril Ramaphosa backer. Former ANC Secretary-General, Gwede Mantashe, was elected the new ANC National Chairperson at the conference, which is taking place at the NASREC Expo Centre in Johannesburg.

 Losing your purse or wallet or having it stolen is always stressful, disruptive and inconvenient. Having your identity or personal information stolen or hacked can be worse. Not only can criminals with access to your information potentially clean out your bank account, they can also fraudulently open accounts or apply for loans in your name. Unsuspecting creditors will come to you for repayment and the trail of debt will certainly affect your credit score.  Nowadays it’s not just losing your identity document or other hard copies of personal information that you have to worry about. An ever increasing amount of your personal and financial information is now stored digitally, increasing the possibility of unauthorised people accessing it or even it being accidentally leaked. There have been several recent examples of this. Besides your online banking profile if you’ve bought an app, book or any other product online, that company has some record of your financial and personal details. Even though the information is protected and secured, mistakes can occur or hackers could gain access to the files. Financial services provider DirectAxis has the following tips for protecting your personal information.

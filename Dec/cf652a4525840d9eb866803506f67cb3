 Responding to allegations that the senior leadership of the Democratic Alliance (DA) in Nelson Mandela Bay plotted the ouster of former Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Ward 1 Councillor, Rashied Adams, DA Eastern Cape Provincial Leader, Nqaba Bhanga, insisted that failure to pay his membership fee is what led to Adams' expulsion. Bhanga is also the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality's Member of the Mayoral Committee (MMC) for Human Settlements. Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Adams told journalists that the failure to pay his 'party tithe' was just a convenient excuse for senior party members, who had also wanted him gone as his election to represent Ward 1 residents had apparently caused a rift in the party as he was the wrong colour.

The declaration fully states that every individual must pay R16 000 within a period of six months," explained Bhanga. “Failure to do so within the stated period, then the member is automatically out of the council.” He added that because Adams is young, he was granted an extension, which ellapsed and he was still unable to pay the money. “The party, at the national level, wrote a letter to us. Since Adams was the only one, who still didn’t pay the required amount, they forced the matter - so we had no choice, but to let him go.” Bhanga denied allegations that local senior DA leaders had plotted against Adams based on the colour of his skin. “I am the leader of this party in this province. If there was racism, then I would know because I am black just like Adams is. “When things are sweet inside, they don’t say anything about racism, but when things turn sour, you see them talking about racism,” Bhanga described. He further said that in the DA, they discuss everything, including issues of race, on open platforms and Adams could have raised his challenges.

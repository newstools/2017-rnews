 It appears South Africans may be finding new ways to celebrate the festive season this year as many opt for staycations over the Christmas period, taking advantage of festive season offers to celebrate at home with family.  This is according to Pick n Pay store data which shows that people are taking their beachside vacations a bit later than in previous years. “In the lead up to Christmas we usually notice shopping behaviour shift from inland areas, especially Gauteng, to coastal regions as many of our customers travel to the coast for their year-end holiday. But this year, we’re seeing this shift happening a bit later,” says John Bradshaw, Head of Marketing at Pick n Pay. He adds, “Many South Africans are choosing to celebrate at home and take advantage of the various Christmas deals offered over the period before heading off on holiday. We’ve just broken our record for the most mince pies ever sold in a Festive Season – and we’ve still got a few days to go before Christmas.”  The retailer’s Christmas countdown deals have proved popular with customers, especially the butchery deals for gammon and roasts (beef, lamb and pork) and deals on the wine range. For those treating themselves at home, premium Italian cakes and chocolates have been popular, as have an exciting range of artisanal gins and mixers. Special packs of pork belly and stuffed duck have also proved enticing for those celebrating at home. Pick n Pay’s Christmas countdown deals will continue until Saturday with a ‘buy 2 get 20% off’ on Christmas treats such as puddings, Christmas cakes, mince pieces, and T-shirts on Friday and tinned biscuits and boxed chocolates on Saturday.

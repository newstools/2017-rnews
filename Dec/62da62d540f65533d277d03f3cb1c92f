 The recent life sentences handed down to 23-year-old Albertus Goeieman is an indication of the high priority we place on our investigation into priority crimes, such as crimes perpetrated against women and children, the SAPS said. According to police spokesperson, Capt FC van Wyk, the Clanwilliam Regional Court on the 19th of December sentenced Albertus Goeieman from Clanwilliam to six life sentences and an additional 10 years imprisonment for the rape of a 22-year-old female. The sentences will run concurrently. "On 23 August 2015, the victim was on her way to a friend in Clanwilliam," he described. "She met the accused along the way and asked him if he didn’t see her friend. He told her that her friend was behind a church and told her to follow him. "She was new to the area and when they reached a bushy area she became afraid and turned around. He called her and when she ignored him he ran after her and grabbed her behind her head. He pushed her to the ground and raped her several times." Goeieman was found guilty on seven counts of rape by Magistrate John Beelders. Mr Calvin Patience prosecuted. The suspect is also currently appearing in the Vanrhynsdorp Magistrates’ Court on another rape charge where he and a fellow inmate raped another inmate on 30 March 2017 in Vanrhynsdorp prison while awaiting trial for the above mentioned case. "He and his co-accused will appear again on 2018-01-25 in the Vanrhynsdorp Magistrates’ Court for the rape of their fellow inmate." The Western Cape Provincial Commissioner Lt Gen KE Jula commended the investigating officer Detective Warrant Officer Jacobus Francois Van Rhyn for his dedication and commitment in tracing and apprehending such a dangerous criminal and to remove him from the community. General Jula says that he trust that the lengthy sentence would act as a deterrent to prevent women from falling prey to sex offenders in this province.

 No one starts a marriage expecting it to end in a divorce (it is after all, “till death do us part” in the vows), but unfortunately divorce is reality of life. Most people consider the emotional toll a divorce will take, but there are additional financial consequences to be considered, and assets that require protection, including those that are part of a business entity owned by one spouse. Many people assume that the marital property regime is the only factor to be considered when dividing assets, but this is not always the case.

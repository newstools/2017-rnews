 Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, on Friday officially handover refurbished ablution facilities at Kings Beach and also appealed the public to help keep them clean. The refurbishments came after members of the public complained about the bad state of the toilets at the beachfront. The handover also coincided with the City hosting the opening of the festive season on Saturday. “We cleaned and upgraded right across our beach front and at wells estate, we are very proud of these facilities,” Trollip said. He added that there is also a plan for temporary toilets that can be used after hours at the beachfront. “Unfortunately, we can’t keep these facilities for 24 hours as you have seen that they get vandalised and once they get vandalised, we can’t fix them in the middle of the season," the Mayor said. “So, there are lots of temporary consumable toilets, if people need toilets after hours that will be cleaned by genitors who will be constantly on duty." Trollip said that he was very pleased that the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro’s beaches have maintained their blue flag status. “If you make a public facility dirty then you mustn’t be surprised to see it dirty next time you want to use it," he added. “So I am appealing to everybody to be confederate and if they have used a facility then they must use it under the condition they found it in, not to destroy it or vandalise it but to leave it in the same condition. “We have given you s beautiful facility that is clean and neat so keep it like that if possible.”

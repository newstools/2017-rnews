 Two male suspects are expected in court after they sped off when Port Alfred police tried to stop their vehicles leading to a dramatic early morning high speed police car chase on Saturday. When it all ended, the men were found in possession of dagga worth over R80 000. According to police spokesperson, Captain Mali Govender, this occurred just 15 minutes after midnight when the cluster received information that two VW Polos were possibly transporting dagga and they were travelling from the direction of East London towards Port Elizabeth. “The members accompanied by members of the Port Alfred SAPS spotted the vehicles passing the Rosehill Mall and tried to stop them, but the vehicles sped on. “A high speed chase ensued and members of the Port Alfred SAPS managed to stop one vehicle at the Kenton on Sea crossing whilst the second vehicle continued and blatantly disregarded the instruction by the members to stop, however, the chase was ended approximately 35kms from where it started by members of the K9," described Captain Govender. “During a search operation of the first vehicle, nothing had been found, and whilst the second vehicle was being searched, nine bags were found in the boot, whilst two bags were found behind the seats! “Two males, aged 32 and 40 years old, were arrested and face charges of dealing in dagga. 26.8kg of dagga with a street value of R80 400 was seized.” Image: stock photo

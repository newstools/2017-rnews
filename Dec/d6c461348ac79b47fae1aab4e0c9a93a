 Responding to a call by former Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Deputy Executive Mayor, Mongameli Bobani, that the Democratic Alliance (DA) acts against Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, just as it was doing with Cape Town Mayor, Patricia de Lille, Trollip's spokesperson said Bobani was overreaching.  In a statement on Friday, Bobani accused Trollip of continuing "his invective" against ousted DA Councillor, Rashied Adams, and listed what he said was evidence the that Mayor, throughtout his political career, has not been able to work well with others. He called for the DA, and the other parties that constitute the governing DA-led coalition in Nelson Mandela Bay, to remove Trollip. Bobani, and the Patriotic Alliance's Marlon Daniels, on the 30th of November also attempted to have Trollip removed through a motion of no confidence, which failed after the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) voted with the DA-led coalition.  "Councillor Bobani cannot dictate how the Mayor's party should conduct its business," said Trollip's Spokesperson, Sibongile Dimbaza. "This a non-matter, honestly."

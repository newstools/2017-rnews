 The Amatola Water, the water utility responsible for bulk water and sanitation in the Eastern Cape, on Monday confirmed that it has dismissed its chief financial officer, Kevin Govindsamy. Govindsamy was suspended in August this year so that the water utility could undertake an investigation into allegations of misconduct. Last week Amatola Water concluded its disciplinary process which recommended that Govindsamy be dismissed for gross misconduct. The dismissal is effective from 1 December 2017. Amatola Water achieved an unqualified audit outcome for the 2016/17 financial year as part of its first audit by the Auditor General. Acting chief executive officer, Asanda Gidana, said that “the chief financial officer is part of the leadership team and key to Amatola Water continuing with its unqualified audit track record.  Hence, the appointment will be fast-tracked while still adhering to the necessary processes.” “Kwandiwe Mviko, who has been acting as the chief financial officer since August 2017, will continue to do so until a permanent appointment is made,” Gidana added. In October, the Amatola Water Board announced the sacking of its Chief Executive Officer, Lefadi Makibinyane, who had been on suspension for eight months. Just in August, the Board of Amatola Water announced that it had resolved, with effect from 1 August 2017, to suspend the Director of Finance, Kevin Govindsamy, who was also acting as CEO, in Makibinyane's place. Director of Operations, Asanda Gidana, was then brought in as acting CEO.

 The successful launch of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality's annual Opening of the Season event on Saturday, which was attended by approximately 50 000 people, was smeared by reports of many residents breaking the law at the event. A 17-year-old was stabbed and died at the event. Five people have since been arrested in connection with his murder. But, that was not all. “What was very disturbing was that a number of teenagers were found to be drunk. There was even an 8-year-old boy, who passed out after having consumed liquor,” Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality spokesperson, Mthubanzi Mniki, described. “Between the different entities (Metro Police, Traffic and Security) of the Safety and Security Directorate, working close with SAPD the following are some of the successes achieved at the beachfront and at the Wells Estate beach:                              Mniki said that the fatal stabbing which was reported after the closure of the event is very sad and unfortunate. "It must be mentioned that there was still a smaller deployment of the Metro Police with Humewood Saps until 06:00," he added. “The municipality would like to express its deepest condolences to the family."

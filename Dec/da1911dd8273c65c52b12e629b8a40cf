 The African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape has condemned the alleged murder of an elderly woman that was allegedly committed by initiates - or abakhwetha, from Berlin. "News of the arrest of abakhwetha from a Berlin initiation school in the Eastern Cape over allegations of murdering a 65-year-old woman are disturbing, hurting because abakhwetha were in the process of being taught to protect their families, women and those vulnerable in society and not to murder them as alleged," said ANC EC Provincial Chairperson, Lubabalo Oscar Mabuyane. "The ANC EC sends its deepest condolences to the family of the woman, who was allegedly killed by these initiates. "We call on the law enforcement agencies to do thorough investigation of this matter with splendid efficiency so that we ascertain the details of this matter and find out, who killed this lady, who was a mother and a relative to her people." Mabuyane said that society will not rest until details of this case are ascertained. "As the ANC we encourage the police and the NPA to work together to get to the bottom of this matter."

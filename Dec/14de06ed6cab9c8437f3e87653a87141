 The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) on Wednesday said that it fully supports the planned one-day nationwide protected strike by more than 30 000 Shoprite Checkers workers, who are aligned with the South African Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union (SACCAWU) on Friday. The strike comes just days ahead of Christmas weekend with many people still out doing their shopping. According to Sizwe Pamla, COSATU National Spokesperson; "These workers will be demanding an immediate end and reversal of the unilateral changes to working hours; including the reinstatement of Sandton Checker's employees, who were subsequently dismissed for protesting against these changes. "They also demand the provision and payment of safe transport for workers who work night shifts. "An immediate end to the reduction of working hours for part-time workers [and] a guaranteed number of minimum working hours for part-time workers." Pamla said that COSATU will be holding various marches and protests in various towns all across the country on the same day. "The federation calls for solidarity action from other workers and shoppers on the day of the strike," he described. "Shoprite customers should vote with their feet and rebuke the retailer for treating workers like glorified slaves. "An injury to one is an injury to all!"

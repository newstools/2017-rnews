 It's going to be a joyful Christmas as over 400 homes in Airport Valley in Walmer, Port Elizabeth, are now connected to the municipal electricity grid through a state-subsidised innovative electrification programme implemented by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality. On Thursday, the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Member of Mayoral Committee, Masixole Zinto, accompanied by the Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, officially connected electricity to the various homes that had been using illegal electricity connection for years. “To ensure there are no new illegal connections, we have requested residents to be vigilant and to remove any illegal connections for the safety of all residents,” Mayor Trollip described. “Innovative electrification is targeted at households on undeclared or registered Municipal sites. The newly connected houses are now on the official Municipal grid, complete with a 20 Amp service and a prepaid meter.” While the country faces a major challenge of illegal power connections, which pose a danger to communities and often result in fatalities or injuries, Mayor Trollip highlighted that the aim is to minimise that challenge in the Nelson Mandela Bay. “To date, the Municipality has switched-on a total of 760 households in Walmer and KwaNobuhle. “The state subsidised and informal housing electrification programme in the Airport Valley community is the first phase of the Walmer Informal Electrification programme which the Municipality is rolling out," he described.    “As a cautionary measure, the Municipality will keep a close eye on new illegal connections to ensure that all parties involved honour the terms of their agreement. “Contractors, working closely with the ward councillor and the community, will ensure that the newly installed system is stable to minimise any inconvenience to the community."

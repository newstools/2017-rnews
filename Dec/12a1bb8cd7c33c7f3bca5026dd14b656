 Willowvale police arrested a 44-year-old man for alleged murder of a 68-year-old woman over the weekend. "The suspect was arrested on Sunday. It is alleged that the deceased had attended a traditional ceremony on Saturday at Dumalisile Village, Willowvale," explained police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha. "The deceased, who has been identified as Nopasinjani Nongogo Mpiyonke, was seen leaving the homestead, which had hosted the traditional ceremony on Saturday, at about 20:00. "She never reached her home and her body was found by a community member on Sunday, at about 05:00, in an open veld. She had sustained an upper body injury." Captain Manatha said that Willowvale police detectives worked around the clock and arrested the 44-year-old suspect. "He has been charged with murder and will appear before the Willowvale Magistrate Court on Tuesday on a murder charge," he added. Eastern Cape Police Provincial Commissioner, Lt General Liziwe Ntshinga, condemned the murder of an elderly defenceless woman.

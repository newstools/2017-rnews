 Two men had a lucky escape on Wednesday in Port Alfred where their boat is believed to have capsized before they were rescued. According to Juan Pretorius, National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Port Alfred station commander, the NSRI Port Alfred duty crew were activated at 09h00 following reports of a rubber-duck capsized in the harbour mouth. "The sea rescue craft Lotto Challenger was launched and our sea rescue vehicle and NSRI rescue swimmers responded to the beach and a Gardmed ambulance responded," he described. "On arrival on the scene, the two males were found being swept towards the beach and bystanders assisted to wade them out of the water and the bystanders and our NSRI rescue swimmers assisted to recover the boat to the beach."  Pretorius said that the two males were checked by the Gardmed paramedics and following some treatment for shock and reassurance they required no further assistance. "It appears that the boat may have been capsized by a wave."  NSRI commended the many bystanders who came forward to assist at the scene.

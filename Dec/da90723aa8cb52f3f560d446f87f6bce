 Eleven people have been arrested for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol in the Northern Cape. “[A total of] 20 251 vehicles were stopped and checked during operations unfolding across the province with 1 627 summonses issued for a number of offences such as speeding, failure to wear a seatbelt and unroadworthy vehicles,” the Northern Cape Department of Transport, Safety and Liaison said in a statement on Wednesday. A total of 3 698 drivers were tested for alcohol consumption with 11 arrested for drunken driving, while 755 speed summonses were issued and another 11 people arrested for excessive speed.  One person was arrested for being in possession of falsified documentation and 20 vehicles were removed and taken off the province’s roads for not being roadworthy.  The highest speed recorded was 187km/h in a 120km/h zone on the N1 Richmond.  The provincial department said traffic law enforcement officials in the Northern Cape are putting the safety of all road users first to ensure everyone “Arrives Alive”. Successful law enforcement operations and road safety education campaigns have been intensified across the province and continue to gain momentum since the launch of the provincial Festive Season Road Safety Campaign. “We are pleased with the positive response and attitude of some of our road uses, who not only abide by the rules of the road but appreciate the operations aimed at ensuring their safety on the roads,” said the provincial department. The department appealed to all road users to abide by the rules of the road: do not speed, do not drink and drive and be mindful of all road users, including pedestrians and cyclists. People must also avoid driving when fatigued and ensure their vehicles are roadworthy. – SAnews.gov.za

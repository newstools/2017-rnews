 The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Saturday said that two cases of meningitis have been linked to the national listeriosis disease outbreak. "While the disease is treatable and preventable, the recent outbreak has resulted in an unprecedented number of cases, some of which have been fatal," explained Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Chief of Staff, Kristoff Adelbert.  "National Government is leading the disease control operation, in partnership with the World Health Organisation and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. "Everything possible is being done to ensure that the outbreak is contained. With only two recorded cases in the Metro, the situation here is stable." He, however, said that every resident should take extra care by ensuring the following: "Should you or anyone near you start experiencing flu like symptoms, diarrhoea, fever, septicaemia or severe headaches, please make your way to the nearest doctor or hospital." Further updates will follow as and when necessary.

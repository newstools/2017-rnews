 During the festive season members continue to arrest suspects involved in criminal activities - squeezing the space and make it difficult for the criminals to move in the streets. "On Sunday, at approximately 12:30, the front door was kicked open of a residence in Hope Str, Central, Port Elizabeth, and two suspects entered," described police spokesperson, Capt Sandra Janse van Rensburg. "They proceeded to the room of the complainant, which is one of the four rooms in the complex. "One suspect threatened the complainant with a knife and demanded money." She said that the second suspect searched the room and took R270 and the cellphone of the complainant. "The suspects fled on foot. "As the suspects fled the crime scene two vehicles from Humewood noticed the suspects running and gave chase," Capt Janse van Rensburg added. "One of the arrested suspects was found in possession of a knife and a wallet.  The suspect was arrested after the complainant identified his knife that they threatened him with." She said that the second suspect managed to evade arrest and is still at large. The suspect will appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday on charges of house robbery.

 On Friday Police in Motherwell Cluster Stations embarked on a roadblock with Nelson Mandela Bay Emergency Services, Metro Police and Metro Traffic on the N2 between Coega and Colchester. Captain Andre Beetge said that the aim of the roadblock was to check the outgoing traffic out of the Metro towards other parts of the Eastern Cape Province. “This weekend high volumes of road users are expected to take to the road before Christmas day on Monday. Focus was placed on roadworthiness, drivers licences, vehicle registrations as well as illegal items such as drugs, firearms and stolen property and livestock,” Captain Beetge added. “About 600 vehicles were searched and checked and 76 traffic fines to the value of almost R23 000 issues for various traffic act violations. “Police also had high visibility at most major shopping centres and malls in the Metro to ensure safety and security for all doing their Christmas shopping. “The police will continue with the operations throughout this weekend,” Captain Beetge concluded.

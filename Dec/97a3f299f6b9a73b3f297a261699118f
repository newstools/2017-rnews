 According to Uitenhage police, the continuous seizure of drugs remains a priority for SAPS members, who will continue with their efforts to rid communities from illegal substances. Thus, a third Kamesh man will face the full might of the law, after he was arrested on a charge of dealing in drugs on Christmas Eve. "Police officials from SAPS Kamesh and the Operational Command Centre in Uitenhage conducted a search last night at 22:00 at a home in Kamesh Road and seized 70 mandrax tablets worth R4200-00," explained police spokesperson, Capt Gerda Swart. "The 36-year-old male suspect will appear in the Uitenhage Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday, on drug related charges." She said that the South African Police Service wants to encourage the community to work with the SAPS in reducing crime and they appeal to the community to provide valuable information that will lead to the confiscation of illegal firearms, drugs and the arrest of those involved.  "Contact Crime Stop 08600 10111 or Crime Line SMS 32211 with information."

 A 44-year-old Willowvale man, Mayenzeke Nkunyuza, made a brief appearance in the Willowvale Magistrate's Court on Tuesday morning where he faces a charge of killing a 68-year-old woman over the weekend. "He was not asked to plead and his case was postponed to Tuesday, 02 January 2018," said police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha. "He was denied bail and remained in custody. The case was postponed for further investigation." According to police information,Â Nkunyuza was arrested on Sunday. "It is alleged that the deceased had attended a traditional ceremony on Saturday at Dumalisile Village, Willowvale," explained Captain Manatha. "The deceased, who has been identified as Nopasinjani Nongogo Mpiyonke, was seen leaving the homestead, which had hosted the traditional ceremony on Saturday, at about 20:00. "She never reached her home and her body was found by a community member on Sunday, at about 05:00, in an open veld. She had sustained an upper body injury." Captain Manatha said that Willowvale police detectives worked around the clock and arrested the 44-year-old suspect. Eastern Cape Police Provincial Commissioner, Lt General Liziwe Ntshinga, condemned the murder of an elderly defenceless woman. She congratulated the Willowvale Police detectives for their swift actions in arresting the suspect. Butterworth Cluster Police are appealing to the communities to close the traditional ceremonies early to prevent crime. "Communities should also report their traditional ceremonies to their nearest police stations so that police can be deployed to prevent crime."

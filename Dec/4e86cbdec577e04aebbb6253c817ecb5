 In the 2016/17 financial year, the Buffalo City Metro set aside a budget over R1.6 million for the restoration work of the famous Ann Bryant Art Gallery in East London. The gallery which was built in 1905 as a private residence for Arthur Savage, father of the well-known East London artist Miss Elaine Savage, is known to attract the attention and comments of most visitors. In 1907 the house was purchased by E.A Bryant, a well-known businessman from the Gibberd and Bryant firm. "Buffalo City Metroâ€™s department of Tourism, Arts, Culture and Heritage identified the Ann Bryant Art Gallery as a crucial tourism facility which was in much need of repairs and maintenance," the municipality said. "The work that has been done include the restoration of the balcony, painting of both the interior and exterior of the building as well as sanding and vanishing of the floors. "However, due to the fact that the gallery is a heritage site, only restoration work could be done so as to depict the original state of the building." It said that the scope of work includes the following - remove the torch on waterproofing on the wooden balcony to see where the rot is; remove all the rotten won and replace it with the new ones; painting of the both the interior and exterior walls of the gallery; sanding and vanishing of the floors at the gallery; painting of the roof and cleaning of the original parquet floors (give a coat of clear) vanish. "All the restoration work listed above was completed professionally and was welcomed by all stakeholders in the art fraternity."

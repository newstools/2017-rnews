 Four men are expected in court on Monday after they were arrested by members of the Grahamstown Highway patrol on Thursday afternoon, after the officers, who were holding a vehicle check point on the N2, received information about a silver grey vehicle with two male occupants, who were in possession of firearms. "A brief description of the vehicle was furnished and circulated. The two members drove towards the direction of Port Elizabeth, and approximately 5kms out of town, they turned and drove back towards Grahamstown, when they spotted a silver grey vehicle, which matched the description of the vehicle that they were looking for with four male occupants driving in the opposite direction," described police spokesperson, Captain Mali Govender. "The vehicle was travelling at a high speed. The members turned around and called for assistance to stop the speeding hired vehicle! "Within a short period the members were joined by members of the Grahamstown Crime Prevention unit and the car was stopped." Captain Govender said that during a search of the vehicle the firearms (three 9mm firearms), 27 rounds of ammunition and three magazines were found hidden in the boot.  "The suspects face charges of possession of unlicensed firearm and possession of ammunition. "Speedy investigative work revealed that two of the firearms were stolen in a recent housebreaking," she added.  The suspects will appear in the Grahamstown Magistrate's Court.

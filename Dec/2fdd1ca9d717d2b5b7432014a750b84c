 The Constitutional Court is on Friday expected to rule on the application brought by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and other political parties that include the United Democratic Movement (UDM) and the Congress of the People (COPE) around impeachment proceedings against President Jacob Zuma. The ConCourt had reserved judgment when it heard the matter in September. Opposition parties told the court that they wanted the establishment of a fact-finding ad hoc committee that would force Zuma to answer questions about his conduct during the Nkandla debacle. The parties strongly felt that no action had been taken against Zuma after the same court ruled in March 2016 that Zuma had failed to uphold, defend and respect the Constitution. The parties were also critical of Speaker, Baleka Mbete, asserting in their heads of argument that she has failed in her duties by not respecting the Constitution and implementing the ruling of the court.

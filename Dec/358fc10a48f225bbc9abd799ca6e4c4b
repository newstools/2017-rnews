 A 20-year-old armed robbery suspect was arrested on Monday afternoon soon after robbing a house in Cowslip Street Ext 32 in Bethelsdorp, Port Elizabeth, and then trying to escape from the law in a dramatic police car chase. According to the complainant, at about 15:15, he was taking a nap when he heard loud noises in his house. "He noticed two unknown men - one armed with a firearm, approaching his bedroom," described police spokesperson, Colonel Priscilla Naidu. "As the suspects entered the room, they saw that the complainant was also armed and they ran out of the room. "The complainant locked the door and two shots were fired by the suspects through the door. The complainant fired a shot and the suspects left with his TV, a cell phone and his bakkie."Â  She said that the vehicle was immediately circulated via the police channels and not long after, members of the Visible Gang Intervention Team (VGIT) spotted the vehicle in Kleinskool. "A chase ensued into Kwadwesi where the suspects abandoned the vehicle and started running," Col Naidu said. "One suspect was arrested and the stolen TV was found in the vehicle." The suspect was detained for house robbery and will appear in court on Wednesday.

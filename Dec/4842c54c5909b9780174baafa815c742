 While South Africans had hoped to have known by Sunday night, who had won the African National Congress’ (ANC) tightly contested succession race, by Monday morning, provincial delegates were still voting at the party's 54th National Elective Conference, which began at NASREC in Johannesburg on Friday. Although, several ANC bigwigs threw in their hats into the contest to see, who will succeed President Jacob Zuma, everyone agrees the real battle is between the front-runners, Deputy President, Cyril Ramaphosa, and Zuma's ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. Gauteng, with 491 delegates, was the last province to cast their vote at around 10am. Counting, which will happen manually, subsequently began and is expected to take a few hours. “We can expect results to be announced late in the afternoon,” ANC National Spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa, told ANN7. “Counting will commence now and we expect it to take a little bit of hours because it is going to be done manually. “It is important to do so because that is integrity of a process.” He added that whatever the outcomes there mustn’t are any suspicions of anything. “There are observers of every province to ensure that the process is credible and has integrity, we are hopeful that early afternoon or late afternoon we should be able to announce the results of the top6 and take further nominations of the addition top8 that will make the entire NEC.”

 A New Brighton mob allegedly killed a 18-year-old man whom they believed to have brutally killed his 56-year-old mother after her body was found outside her house on Thursday morning. “The body of 56-year-old Nothemba Eunice Tsili was found outside her house at Tabata Street, New Brighton, Port Elizabeth, this morning at 04:45, stabbed multiple times to her upper body and neck," described police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge. “The community in the area immediately suspected her son, 18-year-old Lindo Kuhle to be the murderer and set about searching for him. SAPS was unfortunately unable to find him before the crowd did. “At 09:40, a group of about 120 persons killed the son by burning him in the street, not far from where the body of his mother was found earlier.” Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie has expressed that "Revenge attacks, or mob justice, cannot be tolerated. "One cannot right a wrong with another wrong. Murder stays murder, and killing out of revenge will face the same consequences with the Law as murder." Captain Beetge said that both murders will be investigated by the SAPS fully.

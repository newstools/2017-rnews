 An attack on a police officer will not be taken lightly, and authorities will pursue every avenue to apprehend and convict the perpetrator. This is what a 37-year-old suspect learnt on Tuesday night after he shot and wounded a police officer, at around 21:30, on the c/o Nita and Rita Roads in Tafelsig, Mitchells Plain. "While conducting crime prevention duties, the 22-year-old constable came under attack and was rushed to hospital in a serious condition," described police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut. "He is still being treated for a gunshot wound. "Our pursuit of the attacker resulted in his arrest not long after the incident. The weapon used, an Astra revolver was also confiscated." Lieutenant Colonel Traut said that once charged, the suspect is due to make a court appearance in Mitchells Plain on a charge of attempted murder.

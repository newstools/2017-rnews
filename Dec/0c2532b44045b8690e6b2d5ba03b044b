 The Kouga Local Municipality, which has been declared a drought disaster area, is encouraging holiday-makers to use water very sparingly. “Our dam levels are critically low and the holiday influx will lead to an increase in water usage,” Mayor Elza van Lingen said. “We would, therefore, like to appeal to our permanent residents and visitors to use water only when absolutely necessary.”   She said water reservoirs would be monitored twice daily due to the expected increase in usage “If the need arises, water will be moved between different reservoirs where possible so as to ensure a steady supply of water.” She cautioned that the water pressure could also at times become be low, especially during the late mornings in Jeffreys Bay.  “This is, unfortunately, unavoidable due to the high levels of usage during this time. It is a trend that has been observed over the past ten years in coastal towns, as people go to the beach in the early morning and return home to take showers.”  She said a dedicated plumbing team would also be monitoring and repairing public ablution facilities along the beachfront, municipal caravan parks and Dolphin Beach.

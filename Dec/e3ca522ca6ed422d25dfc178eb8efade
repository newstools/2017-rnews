 The Jeffrey Bay SAPS cluster used police horses as terms of transport during the festive patrols and local children were left fascinated by these amazing animals. “The four-legged members of the Port Elizabeth Mounted Unit took centre stage during high visibility patrols in the CBD of Jeffrey's Bay,” police spokesperson, Sergeant Majola Nkohli, described. “The trotting members were given some time to interact with children. The Humansdorp Cluster is ready for the New Year's Day festivities, as the Law Enforcement peace officers are patrolling beaches in quadbikes and the new police Constables are visible in shopping malls." Humansdorp Cluster Commander, Brigadier John Lebok, also appealed to residents and tourists to be patient with law enforcement agencies.  "During these operations, motorists are going to experience some delays due to multidisciplinary operations, which are intended for the safety of everyone," concluded Brig Lebok.

 A 54-year-old Chokka fisherman from Port Elizabeth is recovering in hospital after being rescued off the Jeffreys Bay coast on Friday. According to the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI), at 08h13, the NSRI's Jeffreys Bay duty crew were activated to evacuate a 54-year-old male crew member from the Chokka fishing boat, Sea Lion, following a request for assistance from the skipper. "The patient, from Port Elizabeth, was reportedly suffering from severe chest pains which had started the previous evening.  The vessel was some three nautical miles off-shore from the Main Beach at Jeffreys Bay," described NSRI spokesperson, Craig Lambinon. "The sea rescue craft, Project Group Rescuer, was launched and rendezvoused with Sea Lion about one nautical mile off-shore and the patient, in a stable condition, was transferred and brought to shore at 08h55." Lambinon said that an Eastern Cape Government Health EMS ambulance that NSRI activated arrived at the same time that the patient was brought to shore and the patient was examined at the NSRI Jeffreys Bay rescue base by the EMS paramedics and he has been transported to hospital by EMS ambulance in a stable condition for further treatment. "The crew at Sea Rescue Jeffreys Bay have wished the patient a speedy recovery."

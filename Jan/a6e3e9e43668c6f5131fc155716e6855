 The registration process at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) is well under way, with more than 5 000 first year and returning students having registered since online registration began last week. "As at the end of yesterday (24 January), there are 5499 students registered on the University’s system for 2017, which is nearly 8% higher than the 5112 at the same time last year," the NMMU said on Wednesday. "Online registration for senior students began last Monday, with assisted first year registration having started this week and running smoothly to date. "Breaking down the number of students registered, the Faculty of Business and Economic Sciences currently leads the pack with 1929 students followed by Engineering, Built Environment and IT with 850. The Arts faculty has 778 registered students, while Science and Health Sciences have 630 and 561 respectively. Education faculty has 509 registered students so far – up 85% on last year’s 274 – with those studying Law sitting at 242." The university said that assisted registration for first-time entering students ends today, 25 January, but first-time entering students can still register with senior students until 3 February. "All students are encouraged to register before lectures commence on 6 February in order to obtain lecture timetables to enable them to start attending lectures as soon as they commence. "The University is aware that some students are not yet able to register as those who have applied for NSFAS financial aid are still awaiting the outcomes of their applications," the NMMU said. "More than 3000 returning students whose NSFAS application status was finalised were added onto the system yesterday and can proceed with registration."

 The start of a school year spells completely new beginnings for many pupils in Grahamstown. In order to `break the ice’, the St Andrew’s Prep boarders traditionally `stir the fudge’ on an outing to Grey Dam where they make their own fires and cook their own fudge, using their own recipes. Armed with many sweet things, some three-legged pots, wooden spoons and a lot of great ideas, the boys managed to coax some flames from their piles of sticks and poured their many ingredients lavishly into the pots. The cooking is quite a process and there are generally too many `cooks', but the boys all thoroughly enjoy devouring their creations. After all the hot work on Sunday, they headed back for a very welcome swim in the pool. Image: Left to right...

 At the Vines U19 Waterpolo Tournament, held at Selborne College in East London last weekend, there saw 16 school sides take part, six of which were from Eastern Province, five from Border and five from elsewhere in South Africa. The five outer-Eastern Cape school sides were: Northwood (Durban), Glenwood House (George), Crawford Lonehill (Johannesburg), St. Albans (Pretoria) and St. Charles (Pietermaritzburg). St. Andrews College, Grey High and hosts Selborne College all partook two teams in the tournament â€“ these, their first and second string sides. In addition, Pearson High and Kingswood College represented EP, while Hudson Park, Port Rex and Stirling represented Border. The tournament was split into four groups of four, with Northwood, St. Andrews 1st, Selborne 1st and Grey High 1st being each respective unbeaten leaders of each group. Each of these group leaders won their respective quarter-finals, with Northwood beating St. Albans 2-1; St. Andrews 1st beating Stirling 6-3; Selborne 1st beating Crawford Lonehill 10-2 and Grey High 1st beating fellow locals Pearson 3-1. In the semi-finals, Selborne 1st beat Northwood 5-2, with Grey High 1st beating St. Andrews 1st 8-5 in the other semi-final. Convincingly going all the way relatively unscathed, hosts Selborne 1st then beat Grey High 1st 10-5 in the final to win the penultimate title. St. Andrews 1st beat Northwood narrowly 10-9 to claim the bronze.

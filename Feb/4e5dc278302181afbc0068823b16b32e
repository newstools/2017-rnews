 St. Andrews College 1st XI cricket took to the field against Queens College on Queens’ home field in Queenstown on Saturday, as the Grahamstown side lost the toss and were asked to bowl first. Struggling to settle, Queens were unable to pick-off on the St. Andrews attack as they were bowled out for a meek 126. Nicholas Poole achieved decent bowling figures of 3/14 in just seven overs. In a strong retreat, St. Andrews obtained enough composure to reach their target with seven wickets to spare. Peter Jarvis (58) and David Rushmere (42 not out) contributed diligently with the bat. On Sunday, in a 50-over game at St. Andrews’ Lower Field, the home side met up with UK opposition, Wellington College and after again losing the toss, were pointed to the crease first. A fine 173-run partnership from Rushmere (118) and captain, Chris Benjamin (60), heeded significant go-forward to project their total. Poole finished up on the crease; scoring 24 not out, as St. Andrews totalled 252/8. Composed in their batting attack, Wellington College, kept their wickets in hand to slowly upheaving the run-chase – having at stages the game in their grasp. However, a fall of late wickets slowed down their momentum, as they fell 14 runs short with a total of 238/8. In the cracking stages, Robert Quarmby bowled well for St. Andrews, achieving figures 3/42. Image: David Rushmere of St. Andrews College.
